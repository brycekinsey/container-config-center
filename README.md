## Overview 

This repository is called the Container Config Center (CCC). It's a curated collection of template files that I've written for various services, tools, and projects. It includes Docker Compose, YAML, and other filetypes that I've written for Docker, Kubernetes, and microservices. Whether you're setting up a new project or looking to streamline your existing workflow, these config files can serve as a solid starting point.

## Features 🌟

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: From web servers to CI/CD pipelines, find the config you need.
- **Well-Documented**: Each config file comes with inline comments for easier understanding.
- **Community-Driven**: Contributions are welcome! Help the community by sharing your own configs.
